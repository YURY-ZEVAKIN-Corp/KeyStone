# Token Refresh Long Wait Fix

## Problem

Users were experiencing long waiting times after pressing the "refresh token" button, with no clear indication of what was happening or when it would complete.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **No Timeout Handling**: The MSAL `acquireTokenSilent` method doesn't have built-in timeout handling, so it could wait indefinitely for Microsoft's authentication service to respond.

2. **Poor User Feedback**: The UI only showed "Refreshing..." without any progress indication or timeout information.

3. **Network Issues**: No handling for network connectivity problems or slow responses from Microsoft endpoints.

4. **Missing Error Recovery**: Manual refresh didn't have retry logic like the scheduled refresh.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Added Timeout Handling

- **File**: `src/services/tokenService.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Added configurable timeout to `refreshTokenSilently` method using `Promise.race`
  - Default timeout: 30 seconds (configurable via environment variable)
  - Clear error messages when timeout occurs

### 2. Enhanced User Feedback

- **File**: `src/components/TokenRefreshDemo.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added progress indicator showing refresh duration
  - Visual feedback with spinner icon
  - Better button styling for disabled state
  - Link to troubleshooting when errors occur

### 3. Improved Status Tracking

- **File**: `src/hooks/useTokenRefresh.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `refreshStartTime` and `refreshProgress` to status
  - Better event handling for manual vs automatic refresh
  - Immediate state updates for better responsiveness

### 4. Added Troubleshooting Tools

- **File**: `src/components/TokenRefreshTroubleshooting.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Network connectivity tests to Microsoft endpoints
  - Configuration validation
  - Account status verification
  - Token acquisition timing tests
  - Diagnostic information display

### 5. Configuration Options

- **File**: `src/config/tokenRefreshConfig.ts`
- **New Setting**: `REACT_APP_TOKEN_REFRESH_TIMEOUT`
- **Range**: 5-120 seconds (default: 30 seconds)

## Environment Variables

Add to your `.env` file:

```properties
# Timeout for token refresh requests in seconds (default: 30 seconds)
REACT_APP_TOKEN_REFRESH_TIMEOUT=30
```

## Usage

### For Users Experiencing Issues:

1. Go to "Token Troubleshooting" in the navigation menu
2. Click "Run Diagnostics" to identify the problem
3. Review the diagnostic results and common solutions

### For Developers:

- Monitor console logs for detailed refresh timing information
- Adjust timeout values based on your network environment
- Use the troubleshooting component to validate configuration

## Testing the Fix

1. **Test Normal Operation**:
   - Go to Token Refresh page
   - Click "Manual Refresh"
   - Should complete within 30 seconds with clear feedback

2. **Test Timeout Handling**:
   - Temporarily set `REACT_APP_TOKEN_REFRESH_TIMEOUT=5` in .env
   - Restart the app
   - Try manual refresh - should timeout quickly with clear error message

3. **Test Network Issues**:
   - Disconnect network during refresh
   - Should show appropriate error message
   - Troubleshooting tool should detect network connectivity issues

## Performance Improvements

- Reduced indefinite waiting times
- Better error recovery and user communication
- Configurable timeouts for different network environments
- Proactive diagnostics to prevent issues

## Monitoring

Check browser console for these log messages:

- `Starting manual token refresh for scopes: [...]`
- `Token refreshed successfully for scopes: [...]`
- `Manual token refresh completed successfully for scopes: [...]`
- Network connectivity test results in troubleshooting tool

| Issue                     | Cause                 | Solution                                        |
| ------------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Long wait times           | Network latency       | Increase timeout value                          |
| Frequent timeouts         | Short timeout setting | Set timeout to 45+ seconds                      |
| Interactive auth required | Token expired         | User needs to sign out and back in              |
| Network unreachable       | Firewall/proxy        | Configure network access to Microsoft endpoints |
| No active account         | User not signed in    | Ensure user authentication first                |
