# Project Goal

KeyStone is more than just a project—it's the foundation for building modern web applications with speed, reliability, and best practices at its core. By starting with KeyStone, you embark on a journey to streamline development, reduce technical debt, and empower teams to focus on delivering real business value. This work lays the groundwork for scalable, maintainable, and user-centric products, making it an essential starting point for anyone serious about web development excellence.

This is the result of Sprint 0. I want to share best practices in Web Development and help people bootstrap their own products faster.
Usually, all this work is done partially, step by step, during the process of creating system functionality according to the sprint backlog. Additionally, many technical and architectural tasks provide zero business value in the eyes of the Product Owner and Scrum Master.

# Deployment

System deployed in Azure Static Web Apps and available on:

https://lemon-field-009e4a910.2.azurestaticapps.net

# User Access & Invitations

## How to Request Access

To request access to the KeyStone system:

1. **Contact Administrator** - Reach out to the system administrator at [admin-email]
2. **Provide Required Information** - Include your business email and intended use case
3. **Wait for Invitation** - You'll receive an email invitation to join the system
4. **Accept Invitation** - Click the link in the email to complete your registration

## Authentication

The system uses Microsoft Entra ID for secure authentication. Once invited, you'll use your organizational credentials to access the application.


# Tech stack
The project uses React for building user interfaces, JavaScript (ES6+) as the primary programming language, and Node.js for managing dependencies and scripts. It is bootstrapped with Create React App for rapid development and includes tools like Webpack, Babel, and ESLint for bundling, transpiling, and code linting. Testing is handled with Jest.

## Main Libraries and Frameworks
- **React** – UI library for building interactive user interfaces.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** – Primary programming language.
- **Node.js** – Runtime for managing dependencies and scripts.
- **Create React App** – Tool for bootstrapping React projects.
- **Webpack** – Module bundler.
- **Babel** – JavaScript transpiler.
- **ESLint** – Linting tool for code quality.
- **Jest** – Testing framework.

# KeyStone fuctionality

- **Responsive Layouts** – Mobile-friendly design using CSS Flexbox and Grid.
- **Routing** – Client-side navigation with React Router.
- **User Menu Template** – Predefined menu structure for user navigation.
- **Wait Animation** – Loading spinners and animations for improved UX during async operations.
- **API Integration** – Fetch and display data from RESTful APIs.
- **Error Handling** – User-friendly error messages and fallback UI.
- **Unit Testing** – Core components and logic covered by Jest tests.
- **Linting & Formatting** – Automated code quality checks with ESLint and Prettier.
- **User Authentication** – Secure user login and identity management using Microsoft Entra ID.
- **Toast Messages** – Display brief notifications for user actions and system events.
- **GitHub Actions CI/CD** - Build and deploy pipeline

# Getting Started with Create Keystone App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create Keystone App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
